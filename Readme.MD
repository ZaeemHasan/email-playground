Note: Python scripts are written using Python3, therefore, Python3 interpreter is required. 

Sample command:

- python email_sender.py

Please keep in mind that the script was written for Gmail, and that you need to provide your own data for sender account credentials and receiver email address etc. Furthermore before you attempt to execute it, please make sure that you have set your gmail account's lesssecureapp mode on, otherwise Gmail will reject the connection. It can be done via following url:
